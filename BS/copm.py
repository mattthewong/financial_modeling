# copm.py in PyGo\PyFTr
# This is the original call options pricing model based upon the Excel model.
# This requires that you provide the volatility and the model 
# calculates the options price. This model uses daily volatility.
# Designed in Python 2.7.11 for Econ 136
# Version P1.0 dated February 18, 2016   Gary Evans
# Tested briefly in early February 2017.
# Note to students: this version was only nominally tested when released.
# All time/date calculations have been disabled but they have been tested and do work.
# The default version of this takes today's date and the expiry and calculate days to maturity.
# That feature can be re-enabled by reinstating the commented lines affected below. It should work.
